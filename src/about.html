                Hi, thank you for visiting my website. My name is Aditya Jain. I am currently a student at the
                University of Maryland, College Park, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. I just
                recently completed a summer internship at SanasInvite, where I worked as a full stack web developer! 
                I’ve always enjoyed experimenting with new technologies, whether it’s exploring emerging programming 
                languages or digging into frameworks that power modern software systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right now I am exploring Artificial Intelligence, CUDA Programming, and Web Development. Specifically,
                I want to learn low-level programming and understand complex AI systems. I also hope to join a research
                lab soon, allowing me to gain hands-on experience and contribute to exciting projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, watching motorsports, and playing video games. There is
                more information about my hobbies on the <a href="hobbies.html">Hobbies</a> page. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to contact me, you can find my social media and email on the home page.
                If you're interested in my resume, you can find it <a href="AdityaJainResume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. I am always open to
                collaboration and I hope to hear from you!
