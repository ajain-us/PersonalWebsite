            <h1>Motorsports</h1>
            <p>Currently, I mainly watch the <span class="highlight-word">Formula One</span> world championship but I love all forms of motorsport.
                My favorite driver of all time is <span class="highlight-word">Sebastian Vettel</span>, and my favorite team is <span class="highlight-word">Ferrari</span>. I have always loved motorsports and cars, 
                but my love for motorsports really took off during the pandemic. I am also an avid simracer, racing on games such as the Formula One games, 
                <span class="highlight-word">Assetto Corsa</span>, RFactor 2, and Forza Horizon 5. My dream car is either the <span class="highlight-word">BMW E60 M5</span> or the <span class="highlight-word">Ferrari F40</span>.

            <h1>Counter Strike</h1>
            <p>Counter Strike is a video game series created by Valve. I have been playing it since 2018, starting from Counter Strike: Global Offensive to Counter Strike 2.
                I enjoy the competitive gameplay and the teamwork involved in the game. I am also a big fan of Counter Strike Esports. I have been a 
                <span class="highlight-word">Natus Vincere</span> fan since 2020 but I enjoy watching all teams. While I play a lot less now, 
                I always enjoy keeping up with the game and playing an occasional match with friends.

            <h1>Video Games</h1>
            <p>Other than Counter Strike and Racing games, I enjoy many other games. Recently, 
                I finally finished <span class="highlight-word">Elden Ring</span>, enjoying it much more than I thought I would. I also really enjoyed the
                <span class="highlight-word">Metro Series</span> of games, portraying a grim post nuclear world. I am currently finishing <span class="highlight-word">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</span>,
                <span class="highlight-word">Chrono Trigger</span>, and the original Half Life. I also enjoy visual novels, with my favorite being <span class="highlight-word">Once Again</span>. I really
                enjoyed the camera mechanics and the light hearted story. If you have any recommendations for games, please let me know!

At college, I have another PC, with an <span class="highlight-word">Xeon E5-2680 v4</span> and an <span class="highlight-word">RX 480</span>. 
                I also use a <span class="highlight-word">Surface Pro 6</span> with <span class="highlight-word">Ubuntu</span>, an <span class="highlight-word">HP Envy 15</span> inch with <span class="highlight-word">Arch</span> and <span class="highlight-word">Hyprland</span> and a <span class="highlight-word">Lenovo Legion GO</span>. I have a bunch of different peripherials

            <h1>Youtube</h1>
            <p> I have been uploading Youtube videos since I was in 7th grade. Right now I mainly post laptimes I complete in various racing games. 
                I plan to create a video with my other hobbies, but right now I have no active projects. I edit my videos using <span class="highlight-word">Sony Vegas 14</span> and <span class="highlight-word">Premier Pro</span>.
                I also create graphics using the <span class="highlight-word">Adobe Creative Cloud Suite</span>.

            <p>Since I was a kid, I have loved Lego. I have built many different sets, with my current favorite being the speed champion sets. 
                Currently I own various sets, with my favorites being the <span class="highlight-word">Ferrari 812 Superfast </span> and <span class="highlight-word">Mclaren F1</span>. I also own many Lego Ninjago sets, being
                one of my childhood favorite TV shows. I hope to create larger sets when I can. One on my bucket list has been the <span class="highlight-word">NASA Apollo Saturn V</span>.
